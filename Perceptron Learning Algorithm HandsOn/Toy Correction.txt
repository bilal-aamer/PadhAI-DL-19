There is an important correction in the toy example and code used for perceptron.

-->There are two alternate ways of writing the perceptron function:
	w2x2 + w1x1 >= b
	w2x2 + w1x1 + w0 >=0
-->By comparing the two expressions, it's easy to see that wo=-b
-->We will now focus on the second form w2x2 + w1x1 + w0 >=0 or w2x2 + w1x1 + w0x0      >=0 where x0=1
-->When y_pred=0 and y=1, the update rule is
     w = w + x, which expands to
	w2 = w2 + x2
	w1 = w1 + x1
	w0 = w0 + x0 ==> w0 = w0 + 1 ==> -b = -b + 1 ==> b = b - 1
-->When y_pred=1 and y=0, the update rule is
	w = w - x, which expands to
	w2 = w2 - x2
	w1 = w1 - x1
	w0 = w0 - x0 ==> w0 = w0 - 1 ==> -b = -b - 1 ==> b = b + 1
-->Note the difference in signs for the updates of w (w1, w2) and b.
-->In the hands-on videos and in the "toy example", the update of b is incorrectly done     (sign of 1 is wrong).
-->The notebook available at "Download Materials" has been updated to correct for this       error.
